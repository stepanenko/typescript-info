# TypeScript

TypeScript is "JavaScript that scales." A key part of "scales" is the language services, which are a core part of the TypeScript. 
Losing them will lead to a loss in productivity, not just for you but for everyone else working with your code.

## TypeScript Notes

**Extends** is used to get attributes of a parent class into base class and may contain already defined methods that can be overridden in the child class.

**Implements** is used to implement an interface (parent class with functions signatures only but not their definitions) by defining it in the child class.
